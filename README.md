# BounceFunktion

The BounceFunktion is an online community for sharing good electronic music. We started as a group on Facebook however a tailored app provides more customisation and control when making posts. The aim of this project is to provide a front-end application accessible to users accessing the site using multiple devices.

Features:

MUSIC INTEGRATION  - Share posts from Spotify, Soundcloud and Youtube which will be automatically embedded into the feed. 

FEED               - Real-time updates for posts, likes and comments facilitate the responsive feel of the community. 

EVENTS             - Post and advertise a range of events, from nights out to live music to festivals and let your friends register their interest

PROFILE            - Customise your profile and track your engagement with the community
